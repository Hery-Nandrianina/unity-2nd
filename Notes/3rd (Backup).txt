-Major vibration can be felt ingame

Collision {
-Under certain circumstances, the player fly off the map
(Fall - Walk/Run to a ledge)
=Din't run into any issues of this kind. Probably caused by high move speed while on rigidbody.

-Moving in an inner corner cause several issues: vibration, slow rise up and sometimes passthrough
-Pass through a combo of cube + cylender
=The cause is clear: rigidbody!

-Pass through a big sphere collider
= It's actually caused by trigger found in event system

-Ability to switch between rigidbody and charCtrl
=Feature added. But rigidbody is not reliable! Just keeping it for future use.

-Sync everything with deltaTime
=I guess fixedUpdate is already frame independant. But use fixedDeltaTime to sync with in game time.

-Jump in a wall detect onGround
=You know... -> rigidbody

-Jump while moving in a ledge cause a vibrafuck
= Combine move into a single

-Ability to adjust collider
=Added but doesn't really have applicable use for now.

-What is the real time transform used for? = Fix model center instead!
And don't forget the y velocity drag when you need it ;D

-Refine the drag equation applied on velocity
= I think the drag is already fine.
Real world velocity doesn't have hold!
A multiplication sequence translate in an exponential function!
}

Slope {
-Slope limit cause click on a terrain
= Well, terrain are very big in the first place, it is rare to find a jaggy one.
Use the combinaison of up, slide and slope limit to make seamless transition
IE: bounce player while climbing until he is blocked
and tweak the collider for better smoothness
But remember that it is the terrain that need to be smooth!
If you really need that kind of detail, smooth collider only then!

-Check for infinity
=It should be impossible since the raycast is pointing downward.

-Slide on stopped move?
=No, it will cause jitter. Fall back is what you instead.

-Slide on slope end
=Affect velocity instead.

-Slide velocity jitter
=It's because the velocity to 0 on ground. Check if the charCtrl is moving instead

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!⚠WARNING⚠!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-Slope limit
=Well, fallback has been decided to replace this.
Fall back is perfect for a realistic setup but we might need the slide
version of slope limit in the future for fantasy setup so consider making it sometime! (Don't forget jump on a steep slope xD)
(force/delay❌) (blockade/walk🗹)+(false positive🗹❌) (super speed🗹) (jump-fallback🗹)

(jump) (transition/delay)

-Velocity y take so long to nullify on a terrain after a jump
(Related to velocity drag and slide after jump)
=The reason we need to nullify it is to avoid a new fall to have an initial velocity.
But on a terrain, I don't think there can be a sudden fall/It can be added as slide feature as well.

-Slide on a steep slope
= Added!

-Slide late if entered with jump
=Reset velocity on slide.

-Jump then move in the direction of slope cause a sudden fall down
= This is issue is an outdated one.

-Down speed factor
= Added dynamic speed setup.

-Walk on a sphere click
=Works just fine, suspected cause: high speed, small angle limit (changed to 45° minimum)

-Slide + Down combo
= Disable slide on walk.

//Step Offset
-Stair vibration, bounce
=An alternative could be simulation by a slope (masked to player only and paired with a staircase collider).
(Put on mind that stair is not the only thing that need the step system)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!⚠WARNING⚠!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-Making our own step system
(the default one is not smooth and raise faster on a slope anyway)
(block🗹) (down🗹) (wall col + stair🗹) (raise🗹❌) (lost onGround❌) (diagonal❌)
(slope vibration❌) (side/terrain)/(faceless step🗹)/(slope unreachable🗹❌)
(reachable while walking🗹) (step on air offset=1)  (stair blocked🗹)

(dynamic velocity) (stair authenticity)

-Jump then move in the direction of ledge rise the player [Disable step on air]
}

Jump/Gravity {
-Can reach high slope with multiple jump
=It work for fall back but not for slide.

-What happen after a jump/fall
(rest🗹) (rem slide🗹) (land doesn't always fit🗹) (input 0🗹❌)
(Hard land=Roll)

-During a directionnal jump, initial velocity is added up to mid air speed to get full speed
= Well, it can be added as a feature.

-Jumping just under a ceiling: do we need an extra check or set a crash instead?
-The raycast that avoid jump close to a wall doesn't cover a wide area
=Use check capsule on the right position.

-How mid air move actually work?
=Reduce speed in mid air.

-Should we opt for a directionnal jump?
=Considering the realistic setup of the game, a directional jump is natural.

-Decreased speed in mid air is absolute
=Gain full speed if distance to the floor is small.

-Can't jump on a corner, while moving to a wall/corner
=Well, It's probably because of ground detection combined with rigidbody
but you shouldn't actually be able to jump close to a wall for realistic behaviour.

-Prevent jump on a steep slope?
=Since we can't jump close to wall: it seems that steep slope is also affected (plus the right direction is blocked).
																								
-Jump in an inner corner stuck the player
=It's fine. I guess rigidbody is to blame again.

-Doesn't fall but ground not detected anymore
=Capsule and ground radius should match each over.

-Ground level mismatch
(Reach top by slope) (Reach floor by slope) (Reach slope by fall)
=Decrease charCtrl skin width and tweak capsule collider and gnd related parameters.
}

MISC {
(Jump crash) (jump-boost) 
(player dir fallback) (Fall degree)+(Fall on a certain steep level)
(Cannot jump on stair)+(Stair speed) (Auto climb)

Shield Play = Collider design!
Reachable while walking again = Don't give a fuck!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!⚠WARNING⚠!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Character controller is very bad at handling non-convex mesh colliders.
=One solution is to use rigidbody but it causes a lot of mess. So instead make sure to properly cook each mesh colliders!
Rigidbody Mode:
Stuck in wall, Slope rise, Velocity change from jump
Slope vibrafuck, bounce
}

Camera {
-Hide player when the player is too close
(only distance to head) (inverted control)/(not continuous turn)
=Opt for dynamic solution 'cause this causes more problem!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!⚠WARNING⚠!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-Auto responsive camera
eg: when close force cam to look from above
=Not really conviced!
-Camera show vibration [Average of x mouse input]

(Is it possible: an absolute still camera?)

-Turn camera with horizontal axis
=Well, it depends on your choice
-A ray check is not enough: coneCast (offset)
=SphereCast work fine with small radius (small enough to not leave the player collider).

-Some obstacle can stand between the player and the camera but have proper collision when entered [Layer + collisionDetect]
=Added!
-Smooth reveal on collision without showing the inside
=Doesn't really matter as long as it's fast!

(FPS Mode)
-Should we use cinemachine?
=Do whatever the hell you want!

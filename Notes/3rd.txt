Slope {
(false positive🗹❌ [Shield]) (jump🗹) 

(slope vibration❌) (slide on terrain impurities) (fallback rotate precision) (cube + terrain slide vibration) (slide/fallback&step layer)
(redo snap [speed/shake/after jump wait real gnd/step conflict])
(step shake=down range) (step offset=0/vibrafuck+raise on slope+stuck)


(dynamic velocity🗹❌) (premature step velo❌) (click on circular stair🗹) (stair edge slide) (rem slide after step/raise/step up + snap) (diagonal static deep❌) (step on air offset too high&transition🗹❌) (step down velo&check) (crash=air step/next step/too small deep🗹❌)vs(upper edge slope) (static deep=sphereCast vs deep 0/skipped step)

(stair check on a steep slope❌ [as feature]) (is stair but normal below hitPoint is slope🗹) (cast exceed collider radius🗹) 
(stair upper edge slope🗹)vs(Reachable while walking🗹❌) (Fake step (too close on air) on a real one❌) (spherecast error=coz of checkCapsule🗹❌) (raycast error=tiny offset🗹) (dynamic deepness🗹) (fake fake step) (inclined stair confront too close) (fake faceless❌)

real stuck: bad collider practice!
down vibration: forgotten enabled collider!
NB: spherecast hit normal shit fuck!

Jump/Gravity {
(input 0🗹❌) (Roll = Not yet)
(Slide on land🗹)
}

Camera {
-Auto responsive camera
(close camera🗹❌) (inside transition [gradual] ) (inside collision🗹❌) (next y🗹❌)  
(all smooth🗹) (transition)/(dynamic/transitive lerp speed) (spot snap) (Camera to the side)

-Camera smol vibration🗹❌
Camera transform vibrafuck

NB: Make sure to sync castRadius, offset according to charCtrl radius
}

Animation {
-Rotation and animation for fallback (jump dir fallback)
(Land 1 above ground from table = Jump-Fall-Land transition=premature land🗹)
(fall then step on Air?)
(Walk degree❌)
(jump - fall transition)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!⚠WARNING⚠!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-Foot IK [On Slope Behaviour?]
-Model protection

(Smol walk) (rapid dir change)

MISC {
(Jump crash) (jump-boost) 
(fallback dir player) (Fall degree)+(Fall on a certain steep level)
(Cannot jump on stair)+(Stair speed) 
(Passthrough layer deactivated on touch)
(FPS mode) (Shoulder cam)
(Climb rather than jump = Not yet)
(step baker)

Shield Play❌ = Collider design!
(Slide <>) = leave it like this because normal does the same! 
Velocity transition (Jump/Walk/Slide - Fallback❌)
Check out TODO (Code cleaning)

Character controller is very bad at handling non-convex mesh colliders.
=One solution is to use rigidbody but we need to start from scratch.
So instead make sure to properly shape colliders!
Rigidbody Mode:
(stuck in wall🗹) (velocity change)
(slope vibrafuck, bounce, rise) (new step system)
